Implement a parallel integral image made from the contour boolean array, and perhaps a third made of the boolean
array multiplied elementwise with the image array.  These would allow us to calculate box integrals which include
only the elements within the contour, and also would allow us to determine how many pixels have been included 
(and therefore allow proper weighting).  Is this approach mathematically sound, though?

Is it ok to calculate a shunt a maximum into our contour, then interpolate its position to be outside?

How will rough edges interact with our treatment of pixels outside the contour?  Will this make one method much
more reasonable than the others?  It seems like extrema shunting will probably lead to feature bifurcation when
the edges of the matching contours have differences due to noise.

Do we just only run our checks when _all_ pixels within the filter are inside the contour?
