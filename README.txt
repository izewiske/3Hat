Organization:
  OpenSURF -	 	Contains the OpenSURF source (including modifications),
  			original test driver, and any source code at the same level
			as these libraries (i.e. code that interacts with the SURF
			libraries in both directions).
    OpenSURF/src -	Source code for the OpenSURF library, plus modifications and
  			same-level code.
    OpenSURF/imgs -	Original OpenSURF test images.
    OpenSURF/test - 	Original OpenSURF test driver.
  src -			Contains source code which builds _on top of_ the OpenSURF
  			and associated libraries (i.e. may call OpenSURF, but not
			called by OpenSURF).
  test - 		Contains test drivers for code in src.
